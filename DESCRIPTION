Description: Provides functions to calculate step and cadence metrics from 
    timestamped accelerometer and wearable device data. Supports CSV, AGD, and 
    GGIR output formats, with automatic handling of epoch lengths from 1 to 
    60 seconds. Metrics include total steps, cadence peaks, minutes and steps 
    in predefined cadence bands, and time and steps in moderate-to-vigorous 
    physical activity (MVPA). Outputs include both daily- and person-level 
    summary datasets in CSV format.
