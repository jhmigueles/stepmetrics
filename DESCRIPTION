Description: Provides functions to calculate step- and cadence-based metrics from 
    timestamped accelerometer and wearable device data. Supports CSV and AGD files from 
    'ActiGraph' devices, CSV files from 'Fitbit' devices, and step counts derived   
    with R package 'GGIR' <https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR>, with automatic handling 
    of epoch lengths from 1 to 60 seconds. Metrics include total steps, cadence 
    peaks, minutes and steps in predefined cadence bands, and time and steps in 
    moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Methods and thresholds are 
    informed by the literature, e.g., 
    Tudor-Locke and Rowe (2012) <doi:10.2165/11599170-000000000-00000>,
